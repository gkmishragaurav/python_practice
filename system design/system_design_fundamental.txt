Fundamentals of distributed system
	Data durability and consistency
		We must understand the differences and impacts of storage solution failure and corruption rates in read-write processes.

	Replication
		Replication is the key to unlocking data durability and consistency. It deals with backing up data but also with repeating processes at scale.

	Partitioning
		Also called sharding; partitions divide data across different nodes within our system. As replication distributes data across nodes, partitioning distributes processes across nodes, reducing the reliance on pure replication.

	Consensus
		One of our nodes is in Seattle, another is in Beijing, and another is in London. There is a system request at 7:05 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time. Given the travel time of data packets, can this be recorded and properly synchronized in the remote nodes, and can it be concurred? This is a simple problem of consensusâ€”all the nodes need to agree, which will prevent faulty processes from running and ensure consistency and replication of data and processes across the system.
